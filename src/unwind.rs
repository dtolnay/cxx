    // built in an application using panic=abort, this guard object is compiled
    // out because its destructor is statically unreachable. When built with
    // panic=unwind, an unwind from the foreign call will attempt to drop the
    // guard object leading to a double panic, which is defined by Rust to
    // abort. In no_std programs, on most platforms the current mechanism for
    // this is for core::intrinsics::abort to invoke an invalid instruction. On
    // Unix, the process will probably terminate with a signal like SIGABRT,
    // SIGILL, SIGTRAP, SIGSEGV or SIGBUS. The precise behaviour is not
    // guaranteed and not stable, but is safe.
