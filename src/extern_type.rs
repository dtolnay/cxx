/// A type for which the layout is determined by an external definition.
///
/// `ExternType` makes it possible for CXX to safely share a consistent Rust type across multiple
/// #\[cxx::bridge\] invocations. This serves multiple related purposes.
///
/// <br>
///
/// ## Safely unifying occurrences of the same extern C++ type
///
/// In the following snippet, two #\[cxx::bridge\] invocations in different files (possibly
/// different crates) both contain function signatures involving the same C++ type `example::Demo`.
///
/// If both were written just containing `type Demo;`, then both macro expansions would produce
/// their own separate Rust type called `Demo` and thus the compiler wouldn't allow us to take the
/// `Demo` returned by `file1::ffi::create_demo` and pass it as the `Demo` argument accepted by
/// `file2::ffi::take_ref_demo`. Instead, one of the two `Demo`s has been defined as an extern type
/// alias of the other, making them the same type in Rust.
///
/// The CXX code generator will use an automatically generated `ExternType` impl emitted in file1 to
/// statically verify that in file2 `crate::file1::ffi::Demo` really does refer to the C++ type
/// `example::Demo` as expected in file2.
///
/// ```no_run
/// // file1.rs
/// # mod file1 {
/// #[cxx::bridge(namespace = example)]
/// pub mod ffi {
///     extern "C" {
///         type Demo;
///
///         fn create_demo() -> UniquePtr<Demo>;
///     }
/// }
/// # }
///
/// // file2.rs
/// #[cxx::bridge(namespace = example)]
/// pub mod ffi {
///     extern "C" {
///         type Demo = crate::file1::ffi::Demo;
///
///         fn take_ref_demo(demo: &Demo);
///     }
/// }
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```

///
/// ## Integrating with bindgen-generated types
///
/// Handwritten `ExternType` impls make it possible to plug in a data structure emitted by bindgen
/// as the definition of an opaque C++ type emitted by CXX.
///
/// By writing the unsafe `ExternType` impl, the programmer asserts that the C++ namespace and type
/// name given in the type id refers to a C++ type that is equivalent to Rust type that is the
/// `Self` type of the impl.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # const _: &str = stringify! {
/// mod folly_sys;  // the bindgen-generated bindings
/// # };
/// # mod folly_sys {
/// #     #[repr(transparent)]
/// #     pub struct StringPiece([usize; 2]);
/// # }
///
/// use cxx::{type_id, ExternType};
/// use cxx::extern_type;
///
/// unsafe impl ExternType for folly_sys::StringPiece {
///     type Kind = extern_type::KindOpaqueCpp;
///     type Id = type_id!("folly::StringPiece");
/// }
///
/// #[cxx::bridge(namespace = folly)]
/// pub mod ffi {
///     extern "C" {
///         include!("rust_cxx_bindings.h");
///
///         type StringPiece = crate::folly_sys::StringPiece;
///
///         fn print_string_piece(s: &StringPiece);
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Now if we construct a StringPiece or obtain one through one
/// // of the bindgen-generated signatures, we are able to pass it
/// // along to ffi::print_string_piece.
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
