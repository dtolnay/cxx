/// A type for which the layout is determined by its C++ definition.
///
/// This trait serves the following two related purposes.
///
/// <br>
///
/// ## Safely unifying occurrences of the same extern type
///
/// `ExternType` makes it possible for CXX to safely share a consistent Rust
/// type across multiple #\[cxx::bridge\] invocations that refer to a common
/// extern C++ type.
///
/// In the following snippet, two #\[cxx::bridge\] invocations in different
/// files (possibly different crates) both contain function signatures involving
/// the same C++ type `example::Demo`. If both were written just containing
/// `type Demo;`, then both macro expansions would produce their own separate
/// Rust type called `Demo` and thus the compiler wouldn't allow us to take the
/// `Demo` returned by `file1::ffi::create_demo` and pass it as the `Demo`
/// argument accepted by `file2::ffi::take_ref_demo`. Instead, one of the two
/// `Demo`s has been defined as an extern type alias of the other, making them
/// the same type in Rust. The CXX code generator will use an automatically
/// generated `ExternType` impl emitted in file1 to statically verify that in
/// file2 `crate::file1::ffi::Demo` really does refer to the C++ type
/// `example::Demo` as expected in file2.
///
/// ```no_run
/// // file1.rs
/// # mod file1 {
/// #[cxx::bridge(namespace = "example")]
/// pub mod ffi {
///     unsafe extern "C++" {
///         type Demo;
///
///         fn create_demo() -> UniquePtr<Demo>;
///     }
/// }
/// # }
///
/// // file2.rs
/// #[cxx::bridge(namespace = "example")]
/// pub mod ffi {
///     unsafe extern "C++" {
///         type Demo = crate::file1::ffi::Demo;
///
///         fn take_ref_demo(demo: &Demo);
///     }
/// }
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// <br><br>
///
/// ## Integrating with bindgen-generated types
///
/// Handwritten `ExternType` impls make it possible to plug in a data structure
/// emitted by bindgen as the definition of a C++ type emitted by CXX.
///
/// By writing the unsafe `ExternType` impl, the programmer asserts that the C++
/// namespace and type name given in the type id refers to a C++ type that is
/// equivalent to Rust type that is the `Self` type of the impl.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # const _: &str = stringify! {
/// mod folly_sys;  // the bindgen-generated bindings
/// # };
/// # mod folly_sys {
/// #     #[repr(transparent)]
/// #     pub struct StringPiece([usize; 2]);
/// # }
///
/// use cxx::{type_id, ExternType};
///
/// unsafe impl ExternType for folly_sys::StringPiece {
///     type Id = type_id!("folly::StringPiece");
///     type Kind = cxx::kind::Opaque;
/// }
///
/// #[cxx::bridge(namespace = "folly")]
/// pub mod ffi {
///     unsafe extern "C++" {
///         include!("rust_cxx_bindings.h");
///
///         type StringPiece = crate::folly_sys::StringPiece;
///
///         fn print_string_piece(s: &StringPiece);
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Now if we construct a StringPiece or obtain one through one
/// // of the bindgen-generated signatures, we are able to pass it
/// // along to ffi::print_string_piece.
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```

    /// A type-level representation of the type's C++ namespace and type name.

    /// type Id = cxx::type_id!("name::space::of::TypeName");

    ///
    /// A C++ type is only okay to hold and pass around by value in Rust if its
    /// [move constructor is trivial] and it has no destructor. In CXX, these
    /// are called Trivial extern C++ types, while types with nontrivial move
    /// behavior or a destructor must be considered Opaque and handled by Rust
    /// only behind an indirection, such as a reference or UniquePtr.
    ///
    /// [move constructor is trivial]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_move_constructible
    ///
    /// If you believe your C++ type reflected by this ExternType impl is indeed
    /// fine to hold by value and move in Rust, you can specify:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # struct TypeName;

    /// #     type Id = cxx::type_id!("name::space::of::TypeName");
    /// type Kind = cxx::kind::Trivial;
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// which will enable you to pass it into C++ functions by value, return it
    /// by value, and include it in `struct`s that you have declared to
    /// `cxx::bridge`. Your claim about the triviality of the C++ type will be
    /// checked by a `static_assert` in the generated C++ side of the binding.
