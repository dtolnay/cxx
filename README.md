# Workerd-cxx - C++/Rust interop for Cloudflare Workerd

This project is a fork of an excellent [cxx](https://crates.io/crates/cxx) crate for
workerd projects. See [README.md.orig](README.md.orig) and [upstream documentation](https://cxx.rs/)
for the original information.

This document concerns itself with the differences between the original crate and this fork.

## Development

Workerd-cxx is can be built and consumed only using bazel. See `justfile` for common commands.

## Differences/Features

### Safety: `kj::Exception` integration and panic handling

Generated bridge is fully compatible with KJ exception model:

- C++ code is assumed to always throw and returns `Result<T, ::cxx::KjException>`.
- Rust code returning any `Result<T, E>` will convert errors to `kj::Exception` using `Display`.
- Rust code using error type `::cxx::KjError` can fully control information in the thrown exception.
- `kj::CanceledException` causes panic with `::cxx::CanceledException` payload.
- panic with ``::cxx::CanceledException` cases `kj::CanceledException` to be thrown.

### KJ Smart Pointers Integration

The following smart pointers can be used in ffi layers:

- `kj::Own<T>` - corresponds to `kj_rs::KjOwn<T>`
- `kj::Rc<T>` - corresponds to `kj_rs::KjRc<T>`
- `kj::Arc<T>` - corresponds to `kj_rs::KjArc<T>`

### KJ Data Structures Integration

- `kj::Maybe<T>` - corresponds to `kj_rs::KjMaybe<T>`.

### KJ/Rust conversion layer

Comprehensive conversion layer is provided for many KJ types through [`convert.h`](kj-rs/convert.h).

### Async fn support

FFI layer fully supports `async fn` functions. The resulting bridge will:

- expose `kj::Promise<T>` as `impl Future<Output = T>` to Rust code.
- expose `Future<Output = T>` as `kj::Promise<T>` to C++ code.

The resulting bridge promises and futures can be driven only by KJ event loop.

### Rust type aliases support

We have merged in upstream PR that enables
[rust type aliases](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/pull/1181), which are important for reusing
common cxx definitions across crates.
