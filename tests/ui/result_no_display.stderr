  |                   ^^^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `&NonError` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
...
8 | pub struct NonError;
  | ------------------- doesn't satisfy `NonError: std::fmt::Display`

  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `NonError: std::fmt::Display`
          which is required by `&NonError: ToCxxExceptionDefault`
note: the trait `std::fmt::Display` must be implemented
